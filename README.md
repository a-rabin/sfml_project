# VS Code C++ Project Script // SFML Edition!

This is a forked version of Moros1138's ``cpp_project`` which can be found [here.](https://github.com/Moros1138/cpp_project)
This is the exact same thing as the original, except the [PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) downloads are stripped down and replaced with SFML.

# Features

* Exactly the same as the original.
* Makefile for building.
* VS Code specific ``tasks.json`` and ``launch.json`` to enable building and debugging functions.
* Easy to use folder structure that makes sense for most projects.

The full ReadMe can be found in the original ``cpp_project`` link above.
